Netbeans Module plugin

 This m2 plugin is able to create Netbeans module(plugin) artifacts. It registers a new packaging type "nbm". Any project with
this packaging will be automatically turned into a netbeans module project. Additionally it allows to create clusters of modules, generate
an autoupdate site content or build and assemble an application on top of NetBeans platform.

 To get access to NetBeans.org API artifacts, add {{{http://deadlock.netbeans.org/maven2/}http://deadlock.netbeans.org/maven2/}} to the list of remote repositories for your project.
However (as usual) you are encouraged to create your own repository as the deadlock machine doesn't guarantee 24/7 operations.

 The plugin is also capable of populating the local maven repository with module jars and NBM files from a given NetBeans installation. Useful for
module development, modules with public APIs are separated from those without a public API.
See the {{{populate-repository-mojo.html}nbm:populate-repository}} goal and the {{{repository.html}HOWTO document}} for details.

Maven Dependency vs NetBeans runtime dependency

 There are important differences between Maven's dependency mechanism and NetBeans runtime dependencies.
Maven's dependencies are transitive, so at compile time you get not only direct dependencies you declared, but also
dependencies of dependencies etc. In Netbeans, the module dependencies are non-transitive by nature, you have to explicitly declare all at runtime.
Additionally next to module dependencies there are also library jars attached and shipped with the module's main artifact.
In the Netbeans terminology there is a special sort of modules called "Library Wrappers". These library wrappers
add the libraries on the module's classpath and allow other modules to depend on the libraries within the IDE's runtime.

 The ways in which the nbm-maven-plugin tries to adress these issues has changed over time.

 In nbm-maven-plugin 3.0+, we use walk the dependency tree to detect and identify module dependencies
and classpath libraries.

  A maven dependency is turned into a netbeans runtime dependency when:

    * for netbeans module dependencies (dependency jars that have the netbeans specific entries in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)

        * It's a direct dependency (non-transitive) and is a netbeans module itself. Preferred way of declaring
module dependencies. 

        * It's defined in existing (though optional) module.xml file in <dependencies> section.
Try to avoid this in 3.0+, but still useful if one wants to put an explicit dependency value on the module, or use implementation dependency.

        * When the dependency is of type "nbm". Deprecated in 3.0.x, only helpful in older versions.
Such dependencies don't include their transitive deps on compilation classpath.
That should allow one to simulate the rumtime dependencies at compilation time in maven, however there's one major drawback. Not only are the nbm's module dependencies hidden, but the libraries associated with the
given nbm module are also hidden. So you can end up with less stuff on classpath  as opposed to more stuff with "jar typed dependencies.

    * for module libraries (jars that are packed together with the module and appear on it's classpath directly, not by a dependency relationship.)

        * It's a direct dependency and is not of "provided" scope.

        * It's a transitive dependency, pulled in by a direct dependency (only non-module one - see first bullet) This is new in 3.0+

        * It's defined in existing (though optional) module.xml file in <libraries> section. Consider this deprecated in 3.0+.


 The complete {{{nbm.html}nbm descriptor format}} documentation, and {{{descriptor.html}example descriptors}} are also available.

 Additionally in 3.0+ we perform dependency analysis in order to warn the user when runtime dependencies are wrong.
So project's own classes and it's classpath libraries' classes are checked against the module dependencies
(with appropriate filtering for public packages/private packages).
If the classes depend on declared module dependency's private classes or on transitive module dependency's classes,
the build fails. That should prevent ClassNotFoundExceptions later at runtime, when the NetBeans module
system constructs the classpath for the module based on our metadata generated.

 In nbm-maven-plugin version 2.4 and older, you have to declare the dependencies in maven for compilation and then
use the special module descriptor file to define the runtime dependencies and libraries.
 
 In nbm-maven-plugin version 2.5 and 2.6.x, we tried to simplify setting the dependencies and remove redundancies. A few rules had
to be introduced in terms of declaring maven dependencies though. See above.

 

Multi module setup

 If you have a set of NetBeans modules, or are building on top of NetBeans platform,
you will make use of the additional goals provided by the plugin.

 Since 3.0, if you are building a platform based application, you shall use a project
with "nbm-application" packaging to perform the final application assembly.
This packaging type (defined in nbm-maven-plugin), shall have your module projects
and all dependencies of the target netbeans platform included as dependencies.
The dependencies shall have type 'nbm-file' which points to the actual "nbm" files
in the local/remote repository.

 For the netbeans platform/ide modules, there are artifacts that aggregate modules in clusters.
These are put in the org.netbeans.clusters groupId (on deadlock.netbeans.org or in your own repository)
The following snippet will include the basic netbeans platform cluster and your own
module in the application. You can use standard dependency exclusion lists to cut out module from platform that
you don't need.

------
    <artifactId>application</artifactId>
    <packaging>nbm-application</packaging>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.netbeans.cluster</groupId>
            <artifactId>platform8</artifactId>
            <version>${netbeans.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mycompany</groupId>
            <artifactId>module1</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <type>nbm-file</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ....
------

 The nbm-aplication project/packaging defines a build lifecycle that creates a final application
from the nbm files in local/remote repotories and bundles them in a zip file (also uploadable to the repository)
In addition to that you can configure the project to generate an autoupdate site and/or
a webstartable binaries of the applications.

------

 See the {{{autoupdate-mojo.html}autoupdate}} and {{{webstart-app-mojo.html}webstart-app}} goals
for more details.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
mvn nbm:cluster
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This goal aggregates output of multiple netbeans module projects and creates one 
or more clusters in the current project. So usually one runs this goal on parent pom project,
and aggregates the content of all it's modules. 
The resulting cluster structure can later be used for running the application, creating an installer or similar.
A variant of this goal is already included in the nbm-application project build lifecycle in 3.0+ versions.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
mvn nbm:branding
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Branding is to used when one builds an application based on NetBenans platform (as opposed to creating set of modules for the IDE)
Branding contains all the resources that are to be changed in the platform binaries (resource bundles, images, html files etc) 
to give the application it's unique touch. 

 This goal can be attached to one of the nbm module projects that will be part of the
NetBeans platform based application.

 For more detailed tutorial, check the {{{http://www.netbeans.org/download/magazine/04/nbmag4-modulesmaven.pdf}NetBeans Platform Development with Maven2}}
article written by Emilian Bold. (Please note that the article works with nbm-plugin version 2.6.x and ming not represent the latest state)


+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
mvn nbm:run-ide nbm:run-platform
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
 These two goals do almost the same, they allow you to execute your projects content within
the IDE or NetBeans platform.

 In version 3.0.x, the nbm:run-platform makes only sense to execute on projects with nbm-application packaging.

 For more information on plugin configuration and customization, see {{{plugin-info.html}goal documentation}}. 


Archetypes anyone?
 
 There are 2 basic archetypes:

 The first once creates a single project preconfigured to be a NetBeans module. Use this
one if you are developing a NetBeans IDE module or a module for NetBeans platform based application module.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
mvn -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=nbm-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.1 -DarchetypeRepository=http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 -DgroupId=org.kleint -DartifactId=milos -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackage=org.kleint.milos org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.0-alpha-3:create
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The second one creates a parent pom project containing configuration and application branding for your NetBeans platform based application.
Additionally it contains a sample empty module.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
mvn -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=netbeans-platform-app-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.1 -DarchetypeRepository=http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 -DgroupId=org.kleint -DartifactId=milos -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackage=org.kleint.milos -Dcluster=milos -Dnetbeans-install=/home/mkleint/netbeans-6.0 -Dbrandingtoken=milos org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.0-alpha-3:create
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Note: If you are looking for archetypes for older versions of the nbm-plugin (2.6.x), grab the 1.0.x versions of the archetypes..
 
IDE support

 Since NetBeans IDE 6.0, Maven support available on the default update center. Among other features, it
contains additional support for working with Netbeans module projects. The support includes file templates,
important nodes in projects view, running module(s) in IDE or platform.
Please note that support for projects with nbm-application packaging might be limited in current (NetBeans 6.5) builds.
